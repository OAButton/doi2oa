        <dc:creator>Robinson, K</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>This paper is an exploration into the issues surrounding the rise of recommendation and review services and whether they're of benefit to library users in online academic environments. Should we be taking advantage of this opportunity to build communities and conversations, or should this remain the domain of online trade and commerce? Does user generated content add value to our resources, or does it weaken its integrity? We take a look at the review and recommendation services currently available in academic library online environments, and explore the issues involved in adding user generated content to our resources, using research undertaken for our own pilot project entitled ‘Around the world in 80+ books’.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>A controlled friction damper for vehicle applications</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Edge, Kevin A</dc:creator>
        <dc:creator>Guglielmino, E</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>This paper examines the performance of a servo-driven dry-friction damper in a car suspension application; this device is a potential alternative to a traditional viscous damper. The friction damper is semi-active: damping is controlled without energy introduction into the system and hence the power required is much smaller than fully active systems. Models for the friction damper hydraulic drive and vehicle ride are developed. It is shown through simulation and experimental studies that a VSC-controlled friction damper has potentially superior performance to a conventional damper. Limitations of the current design are identified and suggestions for improvements are outlined.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Adaptive control for a mulit-axis hydraulic test rig</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Edge, Kevin A</dc:creator>
        <dc:creator>Gizatullin, AO</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>Multi-axis hydraulic rigs are widely used in industrial testing applications but still represent a challenging area for control system design. This paper considers the control of a six degrees-of-freedom Multi-Axis Shaking Table driven by six hydraulic actuators. The strategy adopted employs adaptive decentralised position control, i.e. each axis has its own adaptive controller. The scheme developed is based on a cascade Minimal Control Synthesis (MCS) approach, which is a class of Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC). The theoretical background to the controller is presented, together with the results of an experimental study. Performance is compared with three other fixed gain control schemes. The new adaptive scheme has superior disturbance rejection and command tracking capabilities</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Connecting social technologies with information literacy</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Jones, Kara</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>Social technologies such as weblogs, wikis, and social bookmarking are emerging both as information resources and as tools for research. This paper reflects on these technologies and suggests they may be well placed to build fluency in the higher-order thinking skills outlined in various information literacy frameworks, particularly in an educational context. A high proportion of today’s learners are very comfortable with technology and Web 2.0 resources. The characteristics of the information they are accessing are also changing, bringing a stronger need for sophisticated evaluation and analysis skills. Where do social technologies fit within information literacy frameworks, and where can they be used in the day to day instruction of information skills? This paper suggests social technologies perform a dual role: they are not only useful sources of information but also resources to be used to develop ideas and research, using collaboration and community platforms with which learners today are familiar with. Librarians who provide information literacy instruction would benefit from an awareness of these tools and where they sit within today’s information environment.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Inexact inverse iteration for symmetric matrices</dc:title>

        <dc:description>In this paper we analyse inexact inverse iteration for the real symmetric eigenvalue problem Av = λv. Our analysis is designed to apply to the case when A is large and sparse and where iterative methods are used to solve the shifted linear systems (A − σI)y = x which arise. We present a convergence theory that is independent of the nature of the inexact solver used, and, though the use of the Rayleigh quotient is emphasised, our analysis also extends to quite general choices for shift and inexact solver strategies. Additionally, the convergence framework allows us to treat both standard preconditioning and to present a new analysis of the variation introduced by Simoncini and Eldén (BIT, vol. 42, pp.159–182, 2002). Also, we provide an analysis of the performance of inner iteration solves when preconditioned MINRES is used as the inexact solver. This analysis provides descriptive bounds which are shown to predict well the actual behaviour observed in practice. Also, it explains the improvement in performance of the modification introduced by Simoncini and Eldén over the standard preconditioned form. Importantly, our analysis shows that letting the shift tend to the eigenvalue, as is the case if the Rayleigh quotient is used, does not harm significantly the performance of the iterative method for the shifted systems. Throughout the paper numerical results are given to illustrate the theory.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Photonic band structure calculations using nonlinear eigenvalue techniques</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Spence, A</dc:creator>
        <dc:creator>Poulton, C</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>This paper considers the numerical computation of the photonic band structure of periodic materials such as photonic crystals. This calculation involves the solution of a Hermitian nonlinear eigenvalue problem. Numerical methods for nonlinear eigenvalue problems are usually based on Newton’s method or are extensions of techniques for the standard eigenvalue problem. We present a new variation on existing methods which has its derivation in methods for bifurcation problems, where bordered matrices are used to compute critical points in singular systems. This new approach has several advantages over the current methods. First, in our numerical calculations the new variation is more robust than existing techniques, having a larger domain of convergence. Second, the linear systems remain Hermitian and are nonsingular as the method converges. Third, the approach provides an elegant and efficient way of both thinking about the problem and organising the computer solution so that only one linear system needs to be factorised at each stage in the solution process. Finally, first- and higher-order derivatives are calculated as a natural extension of the basic method, and this has advantages in the electromagnetic problem discussed here, where the band structure is plotted as a set of paths in the (ω,k) plane.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Key properties of the box scheme are shown to be advantageous for reactive flow problems. Unconditional stability and compact conservation are shown by a detailed modified equation analysis to enable the scheme to reflect exactly the “reduced speed,” enhanced diffusion, and dispersion which are typical of such “hyperbolic conservation laws with relaxation.” A novel modified equation analysis is also used to show how the spurious checkerboard mode behaves and can be controlled. Numerical experiments for some nonlinear one-dimensional problems and a two-dimensional problem demonstrate that the behavior of the scheme deduced from a simple model problem has general validity.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>We show that for the non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem simplified Jacobi-Davidson with preconditioned Galerkin-Krylov solves is equivalent to inexact Rayleigh quotient iteration where the preconditioner is altered by a simple rank one change. This extends existing equivalence results to the case of preconditioned iterative solves. Numerical experiments are shown to agree with the theory.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Convergence results are provided for inexact inverse subspace iteration applied to the problem of finding the invariant subspace associated with a small number of eigenvalues of a large sparse matrix. These results are illustrated by the use of block-GMRES as the iterative solver. The costs of the inexact solves are measured by the number of inner iterations needed by the iterative solver at each outer step of the algorithm. It is shown that for a decreasing tolerance the number of inner iterations should not increase as the outer iteration proceeds, but it may increase for preconditioned iterative solves. However, it is also shown that an appropriate small rank change to the preconditioner can produce significant savings in costs and, in particular, can produce a situation where there is no increase in the costs of the iterative solves even though the solve tolerances are reducing. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theory.</dc:description>

        <dc:creator>Freitag, MA</dc:creator>
        <dc:creator>Spence, A</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>In this paper we study inexact inverse iteration for solving the generalised eigenvalue problem A x=λM x. We show that inexact inverse iteration is a modified Newton method and hence obtain convergence rates for various versions of inexact inverse iteration for the calculation of an algebraically simple eigenvalue. In particular, if the inexact solves are carried out with a tolerance chosen proportional to the eigenvalue residual then quadratic convergence is achieved. We also show how modifying the right hand side in inverse iteration still provides a convergent method, but the rate of convergence will be quadratic only under certain conditions on the right hand side. We discuss the implications of this for the preconditioned iterative solution of the linear systems. Finally we introduce a new ILU preconditioner which is a simple modification to the usual preconditioner, but which has advantages both for the standard form of inverse iteration and for the version with a modified right hand side. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Convergence theory for inexact inverse iteration applied to the generalised nonsymmetric eigenproblem</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Freitag, MA</dc:creator>
        <dc:creator>Spence, A</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>In this paper we consider the computation of a finite eigenvalue and corresponding right eigenvector of a large sparse generalised eigenproblem Ax = Mx using inexact inverse iteration. Our convergence theory is quite general and requires few assumptions on A and M. In particular, there is no need for M to be symmetric positive definite or even nonsingular. The theory includes both fixed and variable shift strategies, and the bounds obtained are improvements on those currently in the literature. In addition, the analysis developed here is used to provide a convergence theory for a verson of inexact simplified Jacobi-Davidson. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theory: including applications in nuclear reactor stability, with M singular and nonsymmetric, the linearised Navier-Stokes equations and the bounded finline dielectric waveguide</dc:description>

        <dc:creator>Spence, A</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>In this paper we analyze inexact inverse iteration for the nonsymmetric generalized eigenvalue problem Ax = λMx, where M is symmetric positive definite and the problem is diagonalizable. Our analysis is designed to apply to the case when A and M are large and sparse and preconditioned iterative methods are used to solve shifted linear systems with coefficient matrix A − σM. We prove a convergence result for the variable shift case (for example, where the shift is the Rayleigh quotient) which extends current results for the case of a fixed shift. Additionally, we consider the approach from [V. Simoncini and L. Elden, BIT, 42 (2002), pp. 159–182] to modify the right-hand side when using preconditioned solves. Several numerical experiments are presented thatillustrate the theory and provide a basis for the discussion of practical issues.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Much of our knowledge about the mechanisms of vertebrate early development comes from studies using Xenopus laevis. The recent development of a remarkably efficient method for generating transgenic embryos is now allowing study of late development and organogenesis in Xenopus embryos. Possibilities are also emerging for genomic studies using the closely related diploid frog Xenopus tropicalis.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Regeneration of neural crest derivatives in the Xenopus tadpole tail</dc:title>

        <dc:description>Background: After amputation of the Xenopus tadpole tail, a functionally competent new tail is regenerated. It contains spinal cord, notochord and muscle, each of which has previously been shown to derive from the corresponding tissue in the stump. The regeneration of the neural crest derivatives has not previously been examined and is described in this paper. Results: Labelling of the spinal cord by electroporation, or by orthotopic grafting of transgenic tissue expressing GFP, shows that no cells emigrate from the spinal cord in the course of regeneration. There is very limited regeneration of the spinal ganglia, but new neurons as well as fibre tracts do appear in the regenerated spinal cord and the regenerated tail also contains abundant peripheral innervation. The regenerated tail contains a normal density of melanophores. Cell labelling experiments show that melanophores do not arise from the spinal cord during regeneration, nor from the mesenchymal tissues of the skin, but they do arise by activation and proliferation of pre-existing melanophore precursors. If tails are prepared lacking melanophores, then the regenerates also lack them. Conclusion: On regeneration there is no induction of a new neural crest similar to that seen in embryonic development. However there is some regeneration of neural crest derivatives. Abundant melanophores are regenerated from unpigmented precursors, and, although spinal ganglia are not regenerated, sufficient sensory systems are produced to enable essential functions to continue.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Background: Study of the normal development of the intestinal epithelium has been hampered by a lack of suitable model systems, in particular ones that enable the introduction of exogenous genes. Production of such a system would advance our understanding of normal epithelial development and help to shed light on the pathogenesis of intestinal neoplasia. The criteria for a reliable culture system include the ability to perform real time observations and manipulations in vitro, the preparation of wholemounts for immunostaining and the potential for introducing genes. Results: The new culture system involves growing mouse embryo intestinal explants on fibronectin-coated coverslips in basal Eagle's medium+20% fetal bovine serum. Initially the cultures maintain expression of the intestinal transcription factor Cdx2 together with columnar epithelial (cytokeratin 8) and mesenchymal (smooth muscle actin) markers. Over a few days of culture, differentiation markers appear characteristic of absorptive epithelium (sucrase-isomaltase), goblet cells (Periodic Acid Schiff positive), enteroendocrine cells (chromogranin A) and Paneth cells (lysozyme). Three different approaches were tested to express genes in the developing cultures: transfection, electroporation and adenoviral infection. All could introduce genes into the mesenchyme, but only to a small extent into the epithelium. However the efficiency of adenovirus infection can be greatly improved by a limited enzyme digestion, which makes accessible the lateral faces of cells bearing the Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor. This enables reliable delivery of genes into epithelial cells. Conclusion: We describe a new in vitro culture system for the small intestine of the mouse embryo that recapitulates its normal development. The system both provides a model for studying normal development of the intestinal epithelium and also allows for the manipulation of gene expression. The explants can be cultured for up to two weeks, they form the full repertoire of intestinal epithelial cell types (enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells and enteroendocrine cells) and the method for gene introduction into the epithelium is efficient and reliable.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>How low-paid employees avoid poverty: An analysis by family type and household structure</dc:title>

        <dc:description>The risk of poverty is very unevenly distributed in society. Some groups – unemployed people, lone parents, large families, people with disabilities, and some ethnic groups – have much higher poverty rates than average. Some events – losing a job, marital breakdown, having children – also put people at high risk of poverty. But being in a high-risk group does not necessarily mean you will be poor, nor does experiencing an event with a high poverty risk attached to it. Some people avoid poverty, despite being in high-risk groups or facing high-risk events. This article focuses on one such group – low-paid workers – and explores whether and how people in low-paid jobs are able to avoid poverty. We consider three main options – own wages and in particular working long hours, living with other people and sharing income, and state transfers through the tax and benefit system – and compare these across different family and household types. The results highlight the importance of household living arrangements in protecting low-waged individuals against poverty.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Welfare-to-work is an important arena for understanding the changing nature of social policy and practice in Australia, the UK, Hong Kong, and the United States. This article discusses some key policy and practice issues, particularly in respect of social work professional training and practice. Welfare-to-work programs focus on ‘active’ measures and stress the importance of ‘responsibilities’ for all people of working age to support themselves through employment. The programs are being implemented in different ways across these different countries but in all cases the focus is increasingly on groups of people who may require substantial levels of assistance to meet their needs and to help them find and sustain employment.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>The four earlier articles in this themed section are based on presentations at a workshop convened to explore challenges in using qualitative longitudinal methods for policy-related research, with particular focus on data analysis and interpretation. Together, they provide useful pointers to the scope of qualitative longitudinal approaches, and extensive discussion of management and analysis of the particular and complex data produced. Readers who are interested in pursuing themselves a qualitative longitudinal approach to policy-related social research will want also to look to a wider literature to enhance their understanding of issues to be taken into consideration, and to explore the range of methods and options. The aim of this review article is to provide some ideas about the kind of literature likely to prove helpful. The bibliographic references for this review article are supplemented by the guide to sources which completes this themed section.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>The dynamics of poverty and employment: the contribution of qualitative longitudinal research to understanding transitions, adaptations and trajectories</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Millar, Jane</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>In recent years there have been significant advances in our understanding of the dynamics of poverty, social exclusion and labour market transitions through the analysis of large-scale panel studies. This article examines the particular contribution that longitudinal qualitative research might additionally make in these areas, illustrated by evidence from an ongoing longitudinal qualitative study of lone mothers and their children, following the families as they leave income support for employment.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Audit tenure, report qualification, and fraud</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Fairchild, R</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>We consider the effect of auditor tenure on the level of managerial fraud and the extent of auditor qualification of reports. We consider two conflicting effects. As auditor tenure increases, the auditor's ability to detect fraud increases, which reduces the manager's fraud-incentives, but the auditor may become more sympathetic to management, which may increase fraud incentives. In order to analyse these issues, we develop an auditing game in which the manager makes an unobservable decision whether or not to commit fraud. The auditor then decides whether to perform a basic or an extended audit. The level of audit affects the probability of fraud-detection. Following the outcome of the audit, the auditor then decides whether to issue a qualified or unqualified report. Our model provides policy implications in relation to the debate regarding mandatory turnover of auditors.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Increasing employment and reducing child poverty are two central goals of current government welfare reform policy in the UK and single parents – with their relatively low employment rates and relatively high poverty rates - are one of the key target groups for both. This article outlines welfare reform policies in the UK with particular reference to single parents, and discusses the impact of these. In doing so, it highlights some key differences compared with the US.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>It’s a family affair: low-income children’s perspectives on parental work</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Ridge, Teresa</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>This article presents new empirical findings from a qualitative, longitudinal study of low-income working family life. It explores the experiences and perceptions of a group of children living in low-income, working, lone-mother households. Their accounts disclose the impact on children's everyday lives of their mothers' move into low-paid employment following a period out of the labour market. Children's accounts show that their mothers' move into work had brought significant economic and social change to their lives. How children experienced their mothers' employment and made sense of changes in family life was mediated by a range of different factors including their age, changes in income and security, changes in family time and family practices, child care, and their perceptions of maternal wellbeing. The findings also reveal that children, as active social agents, were engaged in a complex range of caring and coping strategies that endeavoured to ease some of the pressures that low-income working life could generate in their family lives. The article concludes with a discussion about the implications of the findings for policy, particularly in relation to the quality of social and economic support that lone mothers and their children receive.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Sustainable procurement practice in the public sector: An international comparative study</dc:title>

        <dc:creator>Walker, H</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>Public procurement is a significant and yet understudied phenomenon. In light of debates concerning the transparency of public procurement, growing interest in sustainable public procurement as a means to stimulate corporate social responsibility in the private sector, and concerns regarding the competitive impacts of public procurement policies, we explore sustainable procurement practice internationally. In particular, we report the findings of a survey of sustainable procurement practices within a sample of over 280 public procurement practitioners from 20 countries and with collective responsibility for expenditure totalling $45bn. Building upon a conceptual model that emphasises the importance of national policy environments regarding sustainable procurement mediated by a range of organisational contextual factors, our analysis shows that a wide range of sustainable procurement practices are embedded to some degree in public sector procurement practice around the world and that the extent and nature of sustainable procurement practices varies significantly across countries.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Sustainable procurement in the United Kingdom public sector</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Walker, H</dc:creator>
        <dc:creator>Brammer, S</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>Purpose: This study investigates sustainable procurement in the United Kingdom public sector. Methodology/ Approach: Sustainable procurement is investigated using a questionnaire that draws on established scales for ‘Purchasing Social Responsibility’(Carter &amp; Jennings, 2004). The survey has been administered across the UK public sector, and 106 responses have been received from procurement officers. Findings: Analysis of quantitative and qualitative survey data reveals there is significant variation across public sector agencies in the nature of sustainable procurement practice. Local authorities have a particularly strong emphasis on buying from local and small suppliers relative to other sectors, health looks generally lower in many categories and education appears to have something of an emphasis on environmental aspects of sustainable procurement. Cost has been found to be the leading barrier to sustainable procurement, and top management support the leading facilitator. Research limitations: There is likely to be selection bias in the sample, with those practitioners engaging in the sustainability agenda being more likely to have responded to the questionnaire. Research implications: The United Kingdom government has an objective amongst the leaders in Europe on sustainable procurement by 2009, and early signs are encouraging that progress towards this goal is underway. Originality/value of paper: This research provides the first survey of sustainable procurement practices across the UK public sector. It also provides a conceptual framework of influences upon the propensity to engage in sustainable procurement practice.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>In this study, we employ the Malmquist index to examine the total factor productivity change in the Greek cooperative banking, using a balanced panel dataset of 78 observations from 13 banks over the period 2000-2005. We estimate two models, one based on the intermediation approach, and one based on the production approach. The results are mixed. The first model indicates a small decrease (3%) in total factor productivity whereas the second model indicates an increase by 6.6%. We also compare the results on the basis of banks’ size and find that TFP growth is higher for smaller banks on average over the entire period of our analysis. However, this relationship between size and productivity is not robust across the years. Furthermore, the differences between the groups are not statistically significant.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>We follow a two-stage procedure to examine for the first time the cost efficiency of Greek cooperative banks. Our sample consists of 16 banks over the period 2000-2004. We first use data envelopment analysis (DEA) to estimate the technical, allocative and cost efficiency for each bank in sample. Then, we use Tobit regression to determine the impact of internal and external factors on banks’ efficiency. The results of DEA indicate that Greek cooperative banks could improve their cost efficiency by 17.7% on average as well as that the dominant source of cost inefficiency is allocative rather than technical. The results of Tobit regression indicate that size has a positive impact on all measures of efficiency. However, the impact of capitalization, branches and ATMs depends on the efficiency measure and whether we control for market conditions or not. GDP per capita has a negative and significant impact on all measures of efficiency, while unemployment rate has also a negative and significant impact on technical and cost efficiency although not on allocative efficiency. Finally, banks operating in regions with higher disposal income of households in relation to the total disposal income of households in Greece are more efficient in terms of allocative and cost efficiency.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Managing overconfidence, agency problems, financing decisions and firm performance</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Fairchild, R</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>We analyse the effects of managerial overconfidence on financing decisions and firm value when investors face managerial moral hazard. We consider two cases. In the first case, the manager may have an incentive to exert an inefficiently low level of effort in running the business (‘managerial shirking’). The manager may issue high debt as a commitment device (the increase in expected financial distress drives him to a higher effort level). An overconfident manager overestimates his ability, and underestimates financial distress costs. Therefore, our first model predicts a positive relationship between overconfidence and debt. However, the effect of overconfidence on firm value is ambiguous, and depends which factor (the positive effect of higher effort, or the negative effect of higher debt and higher expected financial distress) dominates. In the second case, the manager has an incentive to use free cash flow to invest in a new pet project that may be value-reducing (the free cash flow problem). In contrast to the first case, overconfidence may result in a decrease in debt (the rational manager knows that the new project is value-reducing and uses high debt to commit not to invest in it, while the overconfident manager perceives the new project as value-increasing, and reduces debt in order to make the investment). Again, the effect of overconfidence on firm value is ambiguous, since a project that may have been value-reducing under a rational manager may indeed be value-increasing under an overconfident manager, as the overconfident manager exerts higher effort. We conclude our analysis by conceptualising a model of “excessive life-cycle debt sensitivity due to managerial overconfidence” not previously explored in the literature.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>How do we predict advertising attention and engagement?</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Heath, R</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>This paper develops two new definitions for attention and engagement. Active attention is primarily a conscious rational construct, and level of attention is therefore defined as the amount of conscious ‘thinking’ going on when an advertisement is being processed. Engagement, however, is predicted to be a subconscious emotional construct, and level of engagement is therefore defined as the amount of ‘feeling’ going on when an advertisement is being processed. I present evidence to show these two constructs operate independently of one another and discuss how research can predict the levels of emotional engagement and rational attention that advertisements are likely to generate. Initial results from a research system designed to do this indicate marked differences between UK and USA TV advertising, but that that USA TV and print ads perform very similarly. It also shows that use of multimedia increases engagement.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Emotional Persuasion in Advertising: A Hierarchy-of-Processing Model</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Heath, R</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>There is a widespread belief that effective advertising works persuasively within an information processing paradigm. High attention is regarded as being of critical importance in facilitating this process, and emotional content is seen as supporting information processing by raising levels of attention. Recent research, however, suggests that emotional content in advertising can influence brand favourability even when rational content has no effect. This article explores the psychology behind the processing of emotion and attention, and presents a ‘hierarchy-of-processing’ model which shows how advertising can influence brand choice without the need for informational persuasion or high attention. The implications this model has for the development of successful advertising are discussed.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Corporate political activity (CPA) can be an important element in any firm’s effort to gain competitive advantage. This has been particularly true in the area of international trade, where domestic producers seek to bar or disadvantage foreign competitors in the home market though the imposition of trade protection. In the United States the imposition of anti-dumping duties (AD) or countervailing duties (CVD) is among the most popular policy demand made by firms, and as such is a focus of corporate political activity. This paper seeks to understand how and why some firms make more effective use of this process. It does so by drawing on social capital (SC) theory to illuminate the qualitative aspects of effective corporate political activity. Resilient trust between firms and their attorneys is revealed as a prominent aspect of effective CPA. The paper also adds to the literature by including foreign as well as US firms in the sample.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>This paper uses stochastic frontier analysis and Tobit regressions to provide international evidence on the impact of regulatory, supervision and environmental factors on bank efficiency. Our contribution is twofold. First, we use a newly constructed database of 3,086 observations from 677 publicly quoted commercial banks operating in 88 countries to provide cross-country evidence on the determinants of banks’ cost and profit efficiency during the period 2000-2004. Second, we utilise the new database of the World Bank (WB), developed by Barth et al. (2004b), to investigate the impact of a broad range of regulatory and supervision measures, including capital requirements, restrictions on bank activities, private monitoring, official supervisory power of the authorities, and deposit insurance. Our results suggest a robust association of some of these measures with bank efficiency, despite being marginal in their impact compared to the influence of bank level capitalisation. We also reveal, in this context, some similarities and differences in the determinants of cost and profit efficiency, with plausible effects of the impact of the conditioning environmental factors on bank efficiency.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>We present a theory describing trapping of the normally dispersive radiation by the Raman solitons in optical fibers. Frequency of the radiation component is continuously blueshifting, while the soliton is redshifting. Underlying physics of the trapping effect is in the existence of the inertial gravitylike force acting on light in the accelerating frame of reference. We present analytical calculations of the rate of the opposing frequency shifts of the soliton and trapped radiation and find it to be greater than the rate of the redshift of the bare Raman soliton. Our findings are essential for understanding of the continuous shift of the high-frequency edge of the supercontinuum spectra generated in photonic crystal fibers toward higher frequencies.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>This work investigates the reverse iontophoretic extraction of lactate, a widely used marker of tissue distress in critically ill patients and of sports performance. In vitro experiments were performed to establish the relationship between subdermal lactate levels and lactate iontophoretic extraction fluxes. Subsequently, the iontophoretic extraction of lactate was performed in vivo in healthy volunteers. Lactate was quickly and easily extracted by iontophoresis both in vitro and in vivo. During a short initial phase, iontophoresis extracts the lactate present in the skin reservoir, providing information of relevance, perhaps, for dermatological and cosmetic applications. In a second step, lactate is extracted from the interstitial subdermal fluid allowing local lactate kinetics to be followed in a completely non-invasive way. The simultaneous in vivo extraction of chloride, and its possible role as an internal standard to calibrate lactate reverse iontophoretic fluxes, was also demonstrated. Despite these positive findings, however, considerably more research is necessary to eliminate potential artefacts and to facilitate interpretation of the data.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>The quiet revolution of poetry slam: The sustainability of cultural capital in the light of changing artistic conventions</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Gregory, H</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>This paper considers the educational and theoretical implications of an analysis into the artistic movement of poetry slam. Slam is a successful and growing global phenomenon, which both directly and indirectly sets itself against the dominant literary world. As such, it could be viewed as presenting a challenge to dominant literary conventions and thus to the cultural capital of those who rely upon such conventions. Using data drawn from an ongoing ethnographic study, employing semi-structured interviews with forty-four poets, promoters and educators active in the slam community, and participant observation of twenty-one slams in four cities, this paper explores what poetry slam can tell us about the ways in which members of dominant art worlds and new artistic movements interact and the implications which this has for the sustainability of cultural capital in the light of newly emerging artistic conventions and discourses.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>This letter describes a novel 980-nm parabolic bow-tie laser array (PBTLA) that is suitable for high-power and high-brightness operation. Output powers in excess of 2.5 W/facet pulsed in a 1° (lateral) beam, less than twice the diffraction limit, corresponding to 275MW•cm-2•sr-1 brightness, have been measured without the use of external lenses from uncoated PBTLAs fabricated in-house (top metal contact surface area ~ 0.1 mm2). Experimental results presented in this letter indicate that coherence effects are significant in the operation of such devices. Theoretical models based on the simple diffraction theory and on the coupled-mode theory have been used to interpret the experimental results.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>This paper presents experimental and theoretical results to show that in-phase coherent coupling occurs in high-power arrays of parabolic bow-tie lasers. Such devices require simple and inexpensive device fabrication, thus providing a cost-effective highpower laser for high-brightness operation at 980 nm. The maximum brightness achieved was 318MW cm-2sr-1 at 20 times the threshold with far-field full-width at half-maximum less than 1.5 times the diffraction limit, measured without the use of external lenses under low-duty cycle (0.1%) pulsed operation. Results obtained from double-slit interference experiments show a clear distinction between phase-coherent arrays and corresponding arrays of independent emitters.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>This paper presents the experimental and theoretical characterisation of arrays of tapered super-luminescent diodes to achieve very high, broad-band, ripple-free optical output. These arrays were fabricated from 980-nm high-power triple-quantumwell InGaAs–AlGaAs double heterostructures. Output powers of 2.7 W pulsed and of 280-mW quasi-CW were obtained from antireflection- coated arrays, with 10% maximum wall-plug efficiency per pulse at 0.75-W pulsed output power. Experimental and theoretical results for the optical-electrical characteristics and the near and far-field radiation characteristics of the arrays are discussed and compared with those of corresponding individual super-luminescent diodes.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Optical guiding properties of high-brightness parabolic bow-tie laser arrays</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Masanotti, D</dc:creator>
        <dc:creator>Causa, F</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>This paper presents the characteristics of parabolic bow-tie laser arrays (PBTLAs) which are a novel category of laser diodes specially designed to achieve high power with high brightness at 980 nm. Output powers in excess of 2.8 W/facet have been measured from five-element PBTLAs with output beam less than twice the diffraction limit, achieving high brightness of 275 MWcm-2 srad-1 at 3 A (pulsed) injection current (= 22 times the threshold). Changes in the achievable brightness due to changes in the optical cavity geometry and in the lateral optical guiding strength are discussed in detail, using the coupled-mode theory to interpret the experimental results. At threshold all devices operate in the highest (double lobed) array mode. At higher currents the arrays of tapered lasers change to quasi-in-phase operation when the modal gain of the fundamental array mode dominates because of the combined effect of carrier hole burning and spatial filtering from the narrow stripe central section of the device. Similar trends have been observed under continuous-wave operation. The reduction of lateral optical guiding strength is deleterious for the operational characteristics of PBTLAs and linear bow-tie arrays, and it leads to filamentation in gain-guided devices even at low currents. Theoretical results presented in this paper show that scalability is in principle possible; however, changes in the lateral gain profile due to hole-burning can significantly increase the modal gain of higher order modes and, therefore, strongly influence the optical output profile.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Inner-outer Iterative Methods for Eigenvalue Problems - Convergence and Preconditioning</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Freitag, Melina</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>Many methods for computing eigenvalues of a large sparse matrix involve shift-invert transformations which require the solution of a shifted linear system at each step. This thesis deals with shift-invert iterative techniques for solving eigenvalue problems where the arising linear systems are solved inexactly using a second iterative technique. This approach leads to an inner-outer type algorithm. We provide convergence results for the outer iterative eigenvalue computation as well as techniques for efficient inner solves. In particular eigenvalue computations using inexact inverse iteration, the Jacobi-Davidson method without subspace expansion and the shift-invert Arnoldi method as a subspace method are investigated in detail. A general convergence result for inexact inverse iteration for the non-Hermitian generalised eigenvalue problem is given, using only minimal assumptions. This convergence result is obtained in two different ways; on the one hand, we use an equivalence result between inexact inverse iteration applied to the generalised eigenproblem and modified Newton's method; on the other hand, a splitting method is used which generalises the idea of orthogonal decomposition. Both approaches also include an analysis for the convergence theory of a version of inexact Jacobi-Davidson method, where equivalences between Newton's method, inverse iteration and the Jacobi-Davidson method are exploited. To improve the efficiency of the inner iterative solves we introduce a new tuning strategy which can be applied to any standard preconditioner. We give a detailed analysis on this new preconditioning idea and show how the number of iterations for the inner iterative method and hence the total number of iterations can be reduced significantly by the application of this tuning strategy. The analysis of the tuned preconditioner is carried out for both Hermitian and non-Hermitian eigenproblems. We show how the preconditioner can be implemented efficiently and illustrate its performance using various numerical examples. An equivalence result between the preconditioned simplified Jacobi-Davidson method and inexact inverse iteration with the tuned preconditioner is given. Finally, we discuss the shift-invert Arnoldi method both in the standard and restarted fashion. First, existing relaxation strategies for the outer iterative solves are extended to implicitly restarted Arnoldi's method. Second, we apply the idea of tuning the preconditioner to the inner iterative solve. As for inexact inverse iteration the tuned preconditioner for inexact Arnoldi's method is shown to provide significant savings in the number of inner solves. The theory in this thesis is supported by many numerical examples.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>A study of carbonation in non-hydraulic lime mortars</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Lawrence, Robert</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>Lime has been used in construction for millennia, and its value, especially in the field of conservation architecture, has only recently been rediscovered. Lime mortars harden through carbonation, and this thesis is a study of that process. The research conducted has resulted in the development of two novel techniques for the measurement and detection of carbonation. The first technique is a method of thermogravimetric analysis which allows the carbonation profile to be measured within an acceptable time-frame. The second technique is the use of drilling resistance measurement to visualise the carbonation profile. The potential of elemental analysis to measure the carbonation profile has also been identified. It has been demonstrated that the lime/water ratio has less impact on the compressive strength of air lime mortars than had previously been supposed. The change in the pore size distribution of air lime mortars caused by carbonation has been studied, and a theory has been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Five different forms of air lime binder were studied. The impact of these on the structural performance of the resultant mortars has been assessed. It was concluded that mortars made with lime putties perform better than mortars made with dry lime hydrate. Mortars made with dispersed hydrated lime appear to perform as well as mortars made with lime putties, but at a slower rate of strength growth. The use of extra mature lime putty does not appear to confer structural performance benefits when compared with ordinary lime putty. It has been shown that the use of calcitic aggregates can produce air lime mortars which perform as well as moderately hydraulic lime mortars. It is theorised that this phenomenon is not directly related to carbonation, but rather to a complex interaction of the granulometry, mineralogy, chemistry and porosity of the aggregate with the binder.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Specifying and Analysing Institutions in Multi-agent Systems Using Answer Set Programming</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Cliffe, Owen</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>It is recognised that normative systems, and in particular electronic institutions and contracts are a potentially powerful means for making agent interactions in multi-agent systems effective and efficient. However, correctly specifying the behaviour of such systems is a difficult problem. Designers are faced with two concurrent, complex tasks: firstly they must specify the relationships (over time) between agents’ actions and their effects, and secondly they must also consider how agents’ actions are to be regulated through the definition of agents’ permissions and obligations. Such systems are typi- cally complex, and given this complexity it may be difficult for a designer to determine whether their original objectives have been captured by the specification of the system. In this dissertation we seek to address some of the problems associated with institu- tional specification. In order to do this we present a model for specifying institutions based on the notion of socially constructed reality that accounts not only for how the action and events which constitute the institution are described, but also how they are regulated. Institutions may be used in a number of ways, and may account for concepts at varying levels of abstraction. Recognising this we also investigate how several insti- tutions, each accounting for a particular aspect of a society may be composed and how the relationships between these institutions may be expressed. Given this model, we then demonstrate how, using the answer set programming paradigm institutional spec- ifications based on our model may be checked for the absence or presence of certain (un)desirable properties.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>For national advisory services in the UK (UKOLN, CETIS, and OSS Watch), varieties of openness (open source software, open standards, and open access to research publications and data) present an interesting challenge. Higher education is often keen to embrace openness, including new tools such as blogs and wikis for students and staff. For advisory services, the goal is to achieve the best solution for any individual institution's needs, balancing its enthusiasm with its own internal constraints and long term commitments. For example, open standards are a genuine good, but they may fail to gain market acceptance. Rushing headlong to standardize on open standards may not be the best approach. Instead a healthy dose of pragmatism is required. Similarly, open source software is an excellent choice when it best meets the needs of an institution, but not perhaps without reference to those needs. Providing open access to data owned by museums sounds like the right thing to do, but progress towards open access needs to also consider the sustainability plan for the service. Regrettably institutional policies and practices may not be in step with the possibilities that present themselves. Often a period of reflection on the implications of such activity is what is needed. Advisory services can help to provide this reflective moment. UKOLN, for example, has developed of a Quality Assurance (QA) model for making use of open standards. Originally developed to support the Joint Information Systems Committee’s (JISC) digital library development programmes, it has subsequently been extended across other programmes areas. Another example is provided by OSS Watch’s contribution to the development of JISC’s own policy on open source software for its projects and services. The JISC policy does not mandate the use of open source, but instead guides development projects through a series of steps dealing with IPR issues, code management, and community development, which serve to enhance any JISC-funded project that takes up an open source development methodology. CETIS has provided a range of services to support community awareness and capability to make effective decisions about open standards in e-learning, and has informed the JISC policy and practices in relation to open standards in e-learning development. Again, rather than a mandate, the policy requires development projects to become involved in a community of practice relevant to their domain where there is a contextualised understanding of open standards.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>The work of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is described in a set of technical guidelines designed to maximise accessibility to digital resources. Further activities continue to focus on technical developments, with current discussions exploring the potential merits of use of Semantic Web and Web 2.0 approaches. In this paper we argue that the focus on technologies can be counter-productive. Rather than seeking to enhance accessibility through technical innovations, the authors argue that the priority should be for a user-focussed approach, which embeds best practices through the development of achievable policies and processes and which includes all stakeholders in the process of maximising accessibility. The paper reviews previous work in this area and summarises criticisms of WAI’s approach. The paper further develops a tangram model which describes a pluralistic, as opposed to a universal, approach to Web accessibility, which encourages creativity and diversity in developing accessible services. Such diversity will need to reflect the context of usage, including the aims of a service (informational, educational, cultural, etc.), the users’ and the services providers’ environment. The paper describes a stakeholder approach to embedding best practices, which recognises that organisations will encounter difficulties in developing sustainable approaches by addressing only the needs of the end user and the Web developer. Thepaper describes work which has informed the ideas in this paper and plans for further work, including an approach to advocacy and education which coins the “Accessibility 2.0” term to describe a renewed approach to accessibility, which builds on previous work but prioritises the importance of the user. The paper concludes by describing the implications of the ideas described in this paper for WAI and for accessibility practitioner stakeholders.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>The importance of open standards in the development of widely accessible and interoperable services in the cultural heritage sector is generally accepted. It might, therefore, be reasonable to assume that use of open standards should be mandatory in the development of networked services. However experience has shown that the use of open standards is not always straightforward and that open standards do not always succeed in gaining acceptance in the market place. This should not, however, mean an abandonment of a commitment to seek to exploit the benefits of open standards. Rather there is a need to be honest about possible limitations and to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility within the approaches taken in development work to accommodate limitations and deficiencies. This paper outlines a contextual model for the selection and use of open standards, which was developed initially to support JISC's development programmes within the UK higher and further education community. The paper provides background to this work and reviews the current status of the implementation of this approach. Finally it conclude by describing how this community-based approach to open standards can benefit from a wider acceptance of the contextual model and a collaborative approach to both using existing resources and support materials and in the maintenance and development of new resources.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>The phrase "Web 2.0", now so well known as to be generally considered "mainstream", has taken hold online, first as a catch phrase and now as a way of life to many of the bigger, content rich providers. No longer are users content to just consume content; instead they want to take a part in it, to personalise it and to share experiences with others. In the museum sector, however, uptake has typically been low. Some notable exceptions exist, of course, but the key question remains: why has deployment of this "new" approach to content been slow? What barriers exist in museums and how can we go about addressing these? This paper attempts firstly to identify why Web 2.0 is of particular importance to our sector, then to examine common barriers in our particular context and finally the ways in which practitioners might go about addressing these barriers in their organisations.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>We argue that while work to optimize the accessibility of the World Wide Web through the publication and dissemination of a range of guidelines is of great importance, there is also the need for a more holistic approach to maximizing the role of the Web in enabling disabled people to access information, services and experiences. The persistently disappointingly low levels of usability of Web content for disabled people indicates that focusing on the adoption of accessibility guidelines by content authors, tool developers and policy makers is not sufficient for a truly inclusive Web. This approach fails to acknowledge the role of the Web as an enabler in a broader context and may stifle creative use of Web content and experiences to enhance social inclusion. Using e-learning as an example, and describing current metadata developments, we present a framework that will guide Web authors and policy makers in addressing accessibility at a higher level, by defining the context in which a Web resource will be used and considering how best existing or new alternatives may be combined to enhance the accessibility of the information and services provided by the site in question. We demonstrate how guidelines such as those produced by the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative have a role to play within this wider context, along with metadata and user profiling initiatives.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Chiral sulfoximines have applications as transition-state mimicking enzyme inhibitors, as peptide isosteres and as chiral auxiliaries in synthesis. To access the required O-protected 4- (arylsulfonimidoyl)butane-1,2,3-triols, 4S,5S-di(hydroxymethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane (prepared from diethyl R,R-tartrate) was converted into its monobenzyl ether. Mitsunobu-like coupling with thiophenols gave 4S,5R-4-(benzyloxymethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-5-(arylthiomethyl)- 1,3-dioxolanes. Sulfoxidation and S-imination (trifluoroacetamide, iodosobenzene diacetate, rhodium acetate) proceeded without stereoselectivity, giving inseparable diastereomeric mixtures of 4S,5R,S(±)-4-(benzyloxymethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-5-(N-(trifluoroacetyl)arylsulfonimidoylmethyl)- 1,3-dioxolanes. Removal of the trifluoroacetyl protection allowed chromatographic separation of the diastereomeric 4S,5R,S(±)-4-(benzyloxymethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-5- (arylsulfonimidoylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolanes. The configurations at sulfur were determined by X-ray crystallography and some analysis of the solution and solid-state conformations was carried out. The resulting O-protected 4-(arylsulfonimidoyl)butane-1,2,3-triols are of use in developing enzyme inhibitors.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>An experimental study was performed to evaluate the effect of a cold jet on a single trailing vortex. Flow visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements were conducted in wind and water tunnels. The main parameters were the ratio of jet-to-vortex strength, the jet-to-vortex distance, the jet inclination angle and the Reynolds number. It was shown that the jet turbulence is wrapped around the vortex and ingested into it. This takes place faster with decreasing jet-to-vortex distance and increasing jet strength. Both time-averaged and instantaneous flow fields showed that the trailing vortex became diffused with its rotational velocity and vorticity levels reduced when the jet is located close to the vortex. The mechanism with which the jet interacts with the vortex is a combination of vortices shed by the jet and the turbulence. No noticeable differences were found within the Reynolds number range tested. The effect of jet on the vortex is delayed when the jet is blowing at an angle to the free stream and away from the vortex such as during take-off.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Vortex control concepts employed for slender and nonslender delta wings were reviewed. Important aspects of flow control include flow separation, vortex formation, flow reattachment, vortex breakdown, and vortex instabilities. The occurrence and relative importance of these phenomena strongly depend on the wing sweep angle. Various flow control methods were discussed: multiple vortices, control surfaces, blowing and suction, low-frequency and high-frequency excitation, feedback control, passive control with wing flexibility, and plasma actuators. For slender delta wings, control of vortex breakdown is achieved by modifications to swirl level and external pressure gradient acting on the vortex core. Effects of flow control methods on these two parameters were discussed, and their effectiveness was compared whenever possible. With the high-frequency excitation of the separated shear layer, reattachment and lift enhancement in the post-stall region is observed, which is orders of magnitude more effective than steady blowing. This effect is more pronounced for nonslender wings. Re-formation of vortices is possible with sufficient amplitude of forcing at the optimum frequency. Passive lift enhancement on flexible wings is due to the self-excited wing vibrations, which occur when the frequency of wing vibrations is close to the frequency of the shear layer instabilities, and promote flow reattachment.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Unsteady aerodynamics of nonslender delta wings, covering topics of shear layer instabilities, structure of nonslender vortices, breakdown, maneuvering wings, and fluid/structure interactions, are reviewed in this paper. Vortical flows develop at very low angles of attack, and form close to the wing surface. This results in strong interactions with the upper-surface boundary layer and in a pronounced dependence of the flow structure on Reynolds number. Vortex breakdown is observed to be much less abrupt compared to breakdown over slender wings. This results in challenges for the precise determination of vortex breakdown location and the interpretation of flow visualizations. One of the distinct features of nonslender wings is the location of the primary attachment zone outboard of the symmetry plane. Reattachment location correlates with the wing stall process and increased buffeting. Dramatic fluid/structure interactions emerge with increasing wing flexibility and result in substantial lift enhancement in the post-stall region. This recently discovered phenomenon appears to be a feature of nonslender wings. Rigid delta wings undergoing small amplitude oscillations in the post-stall region exhibit many similarities to flexible wings, including reattachment and re-formation of the leading-edge vortices. Unusual self-excited roll oscillations have also been observed for free-to-roll nonslender wings.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>The stratosphere-mesosphere response to the major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) in the winter of 2003/2004 has been studied. The UKMO (UK Met. Office) data set was used to examine the features of the large-scale thermo-dynamic anomalies present in the stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere. The vertical and latitudinal structure of the genuine anomalies, emphasized by removing the UKMO climatology, has been investigated as well. The features of the stratospheric anomalies have been related to the mesospheric ones in measured neutral winds from radars and temperatures from meteor radars (~90 km). It was found that the stratospheric warming spread to the lower mesosphere, while cooling occurred in the upper mesosphere, a feature which may be related to the large vertical scales of the stationary planetary waves (SPWs). It was shown also that the beginning of the eastward wind deceleration in the stratosphere/mesosphere system coincided with the maximum amplification of the SPW1 accompanied by short-lived bursts of waves 2 and 3.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>The 1.5-5-day eastward waves in the upper stratosphere-mesosphere as observed by the Esrange meteor radar and the SABER instrument</dc:title>

        <dc:description>Data of neutral meridional wind obtained by the meteor radar at Esrange and data of temperature and pressure measured by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on board the Thermosphere–Ionosphere–Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) spacecraft were studied with respect to a day-to-day atmospheric variability with periods from 1.5 to 5 days. The detailed analysis was carried out for February 2004. Perturbations of the atmospheric parameters at the examined periods appeared mainly as eastward propagating waves of zonal wavenumbers 1 and 2. We suggested that these waves excited by the jet instability on both flanks of the polar night jet in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere interact non-linearly with each other, and this interaction generates secondary waves. The radar observed both primary and secondary waves at mesospheric heights. The data analysis supports this suggestion. Under conditions of weaker instability observed in February 2003 the perturbations of atmospheric parameters of periods from 1.5 to 5 days had smaller amplitudes at heights of the mesosphere than those in February 2004. It was found that the Eliassen-Palm fluxes calculated for the waves generated by the jet instability were mainly downward directed. This result suggests a possible dynamical influence of the mesospheric layers on the lower atmospheric levels.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Felbamate but not phenytoin or gabapentin reduces glutamate release by blocking presynaptic NMDA receptors in the entorhinal cortex</dc:title>

        <dc:description>We have shown that a number of anticonvulsant drugs can reduce glutamate release at synapses in the rat entorhinal cortex (EC) in vitro. We have also shown that presynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDAr) tonically facilitate glutamate release at these synapses. In the present study we determined whether, phenytoin, gabapentin and felbamate may reduce glutamate release by blocking the presynaptic NMDAr. Whole cell patch clamp recordings of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were used as a monitor of presynaptic glutamate release. Postsynaptic NMDAr were blocked with internal dialysis with an NMDAr channel blocker. The antagonist, 2-AP5, reduced the frequency of sEPSCs by blocking the presynaptic facilitatory NMDAr, but did not occlude a reduction in sEPSC frequency by gabapentin or phenytoin. Felbamate also reduced sEPSC frequency, but this effect was occluded by prior application of 2-AP5. Thus, whilst all three drugs can reduce glutamate release, only the action of felbamate seems to be due to interaction with presynaptic NMDAr.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Simultaneous estimation of global background synaptic inhibition and excitation from membrane potential fluctuations in layer III layer III neurones of the rat entorhinal cortex in vitro</dc:title>

        <dc:description>It is becoming clear that the detection and integration of synaptic input and its conversion into an output signal in cortical neurones is strongly influenced by background synaptic activity or “noise”. The majority of this noise results from the spontaneous release of synaptic transmitters, interacting with ligand-gated ion channels in the postsynaptic neurone (e.g. Berretta and Jones, 1996; Jones and Woodhall, 2005; LoTurco et al., 1990; Otis et al., 1991; Ropert et al., 1991; Salin and Prince, 1996; Staley, 1999; Woodhall et al., 2005). The function of synaptic noise has been the subject of debate for some years, but there is increasing evidence that it modifies or controls neuronal excitability and, thus, the integrative properties of cortical neurones. In the present study we have investigated a novel approach (Rudolph et al., 2004) to simultaneously quantify synaptic inhibitory and excitatory synaptic noise, together with postsynaptic excitability, in rat entorhinal cortical neurones in vitro. The results suggest that this is a viable and useful approach to the study of the function of synaptic noise in cortical networks.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Vertical coupling in the low-latitude atmosphere-ionosphere system driven by the 5-day Rossby W1 and 6-day Kelvin E1 waves in the low-latitude MLT region has been investigated. Three different types of data were analysed in order to detect and extract the ~6-day wave signals. The National Centres for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) geopotential height and zonal wind data at two pressure levels, 30 and 10hPa, were used to explore the features of the ~6-day waves present in the stratosphere during the period from 1 July to 31 December 2004. The ~6-day wave activity was identified in the neutral MLT winds by radar measurements located at four equatorial and three tropical stations. The ~6-day variations in the ionospheric electric currents (registered by perturbations in the geomagnetic field) were detected in the data from 26 magnetometer stations situated at low latitudes. The analysis shows that the global ~6-day Kelvin E1 and ~6-day Rossby W1 waves observed in the low-latitude MLT region are most probably vertically propagating from the stratosphere. The global ~6-day W1 and E1 waves seen in the ionospheric electric currents are caused by the simultaneous ~6-day wave activity in the MLT region. The main forcing agent in the equatorial MLT region seems to be the waves themselves, whereas in the tropical MLT region the modulated tides are also of importance.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>We have shown previously that when postsynaptic NMDA receptors are blocked, the frequency, but not amplitude, of spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) at synapses in the entorhinal cortex is reduced by NMDA receptor antagonists, demonstrating that glutamate release is tonically facilitated by presynaptic NMDA autoreceptors. In the present study, we recorded sEPSCs using whole-cell voltage clamp in neurons in layer V in slices of the rat entorhinal cortex. Using specific antagonists for NR2A [(R)-[(S)-1-(4-bromo-phenyl)-ethylamino]-(2,3-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalin-5-yl)-methyl]-phosphonic acid] and NR2B [(αR,ßS)-α-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ß -methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidinepropanol hydrochloride (Ro 25-6981)] subunit-containing receptors, we confirmed that in slices from juvenile rats (4–6 weeks of age), the autoreceptor is predominantly of the NR1–NR2B subtype. In older (4–6 months of age) control animals, the effect of the NR2B antagonist was less marked, suggesting a decline in autoreceptor function with development. In slices from rats (aged 4–6 months) exhibiting spontaneous recurrent seizures induced with a lithium-pilocarpine protocol, Ro 25-6981 again robustly reduced sEPSC frequency. The effect was equal to or greater than that seen in the juvenile slices and much more pronounced than that seen in the age-matched control animals. In all three groups, the NR2A antagonist was without effect on sEPSCs. These results suggest that there is a developmental decrease in NMDA autoreceptor function, which is reversed in a chronic epileptic condition. The enhanced autoreceptor function may contribute to seizure susceptibility and epileptogenesis in temporal lobe structures.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>This paper describes a layered approach to selection and use of open standards which is being developed to support development work within the UK higher and further educational communities. This approach reflects the diversity of the technical environment, the service provider's environment, user requirements and maturity of standards by separating contextual aspects; technical and non-technical policies; the selection of appropriate solutions and the compliance layer. To place the layered approach in context, case studies are provided of the types of environments in which the standards framework can be implemented. The paper describes how this contextual approach can be extended to address other areas such as Web accessibility and use of open source software. Use of a common model can provide consistent approaches by funding bodies and shared understanding for developers. This contextual approach is being extended to support development work with other public sector organizations within the UK. We describe how the approach is well-suited to ensure common ways of working across disparate sets of organizations and how the approach can be applied within a wider context.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>The Semantic Web seeks to build a global distributed database through the integration of data from independent communities without the requirement for prior agreement on the structure of this data. This basic concept can be applied to the development of online communities. This paper outlines the potential for the FOAF Semantic Web technology to ensure that resources can be defined in a way that promotes their ability for being shared with third-parties with a minimum of integration effort. The paper outlines FOAF’s potential for community-building in conferences.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Archiving Web Site Resources: A Records Management View</dc:title>
        <dc:description>In this paper, we propose the use of records management principles to identify and manage Web site resources with enduring value as records. Current Web archiving activities, collaborative or organisational, whilst extremely valuable in their own right, often do not and cannot incorporate requirements for proper records management. Material collected under such initiatives therefore may not be reliable or authentic from a legal or archival perspective, with insufficient metadata collected about the object during its active life, and valuable materials destroyed whilst ephemeral items are maintained. Education, training, and collaboration between stakeholders are integral to avoiding these risks and successfully preserving valuable Web-based materials.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>The importance of accessibility to digital resources is now widely acknowledged. The W3C WAI has played a significant role in promoting the importance of accessibility and developing a framework for accessible Web resources. The accessibility of e-learning provides additional challenges that may not be faced when providing access to other Web resources. The authors argue that there is a need for a more sophisticated model for addressing e-learning accessibility which takes into account the usability of e-learning, pedagogic issues and student learning styles in addition to technical and resource issues. The authors expand on these issues and propose a holistic model for the development of accessible e-learning resources.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Tuberculosis is an increasing threat, owing to the spread of AIDS and to the development of resistance of the causative organism, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, to the currently available drugs. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is an important enzyme of the folate cycle; inhibition of DHFR inhibits growth and causes cell death. The crystal structure of M. tuberculosis DHFR revealed a glycerol tightly bound close to the binding site for the substrate dihydrofolate; this glycerol-binding motif is absent from the human enzyme. A series of pyrimidine-2,4-diamines was designed with a two-carbon tether between a glycerol-mimicking triol and the 6-position of the heterocycle; these compounds also carried aryl substituents at the 5-position. These, their diastereoisomers, analogues lacking two hydroxy groups and analogues lacking the two-carbon spacing linker were synthesised by acylation of the anions derived from phenylacetonitriles with ethyl (4S,5R)-4-benzyloxymethyl-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-propanoate, ethyl (4S,5S)-4-benzyloxymethyl-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-propanoate, tetrahydrooxepin-2-one and 2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-erythronolactone, respectively, to give the corresponding α-acylphenylacetonitriles. Formation of the methyl enol ethers, condensation with guanidine and deprotection gave the pyrimidine-2,4-diamines. Preliminary assay of the abilities of these compounds to inhibit the growth of TB5 Saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying the DHFR genes from M. tuberculosis, human and yeast indicated that 5-phenyl-6-((3R,4S)-3,4,5-trihydroxypentyl)pyrimidine-2,4-diamine selectively inhibited M. tuberculosis DHFR and had little effect on the human or yeast enzymes.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>As digital library services develop from project demonstrators to mature, mission-critical services it becomes necessary to implement systematic procedures in order to ensure the quality of the content, the functionality of the service, accessibility to a wide range of users and interoperability with other services. This paper describes a quality assurance methodology which has been developed for digital library programmes in the UK higher education sector. The paper describes the approaches taken by the SOSIG subject gateway service in developing and maintaining a national service which is dependent on quality metadata. The paper then outlines a quality assurance framework which has been developed to support the JISC's digital library programmes in the UK and its application to metadata.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Interoperability Across Digital Library Programmes? We Must Have QA!</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Kelly, B</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>Digital library programmes often seek to provide interoperability through use of open standards. In practice, however, deployment of open standards in a compliant manner is not necessarily easy. The author argues that a strict checking regime would be inappropriate in many circumstances. The author proposes deployment of quality assurance (QA) principles which provide documented policies on the standards and best practices to be implemented and systematic procedures for measuring compliance with these policies. The paper describes the work of the QA Focus project which has developed a QA methodology to support JISC's digital library programmes. A summary of the application of the methodology to support selection of standards and the deployment of deliverables into service is given. The author argues that similar approaches are needed if we are to provide interoperability across digital library programmes.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>An Evaluation of Interpolation Techniques for Reconstructing Ionospheric TEC Maps</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Foster, Matthew</dc:creator>
        <dc:creator>Evans, A</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>Maps of the total electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere can be reconstructed using data extracted from GPS signals. For historic and other sparse data sets the reconstruction of TEC images is often performed using a multivariate interpolation technique. Although there are many interpolation methods available only a limited number, for example kriging, have been applied to TEC data. This paper presents a quantitative comparison of various commonly used algorithms for scattered data interpolation over a range of sparsities. Techniques evaluated include a relatively new approach called adaptive normalised convolution ANC, that has not previously been applied to ionospheric reconstruction. The proposed evaluation scheme employs a quantitative methodology applied to both simulated and real TEC data. Results show that although the performance of kriging is good in many cases, it is several times worse than the best performing techniques at some sparsities. Natural neighbour interpolation has a better overall performance than kriging for both simulated and TEC data. Although its performance is a few percent worse than other methods for the simulated data, ANC produces the best performance for the TEC reconstructions.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Trade Integration and Business Cycle Convergence: Is the Relation Robust Across Time and Space?</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Xing, T</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>This thesis investigates the relationship between business cycle correlation and trade intensity for a group of 24 countries over the period 1959 to 2003. Previous studies have not accounted for the possibility that the business cycle correlation may be influenced by unobservable country pair specific effects. Our estimates are produced using both fixed and random effects procedures and allow for the possibility that trade intensity could be endogenous. Both methodologies suggest that the greater economic convergence is strongly influenced by rises in bilateral trade intensity. A couple of sensitivity analyses prove that the relationship is robust, such as sub-period analysis or adding potential omitted variables. However, the magnitude and significance of the estimated relationship is not the same for all countries. Our evidence indicates that trade amongst the European countries has had the most beneficial effect on business cycle co-movements which, from optimum currency area (OCA) theory, would support the decision of most of these economies to join European Monetary Union (EMU). But all non-European countries (except China) have not shown positive or significant relationships. In addition, the determinants of business cycle co-movements are extended to trade intensity, industry specialisation and financial integration for a sample of 15 OECD countries from 1984 to 2003. We still find the positive and statistically significant impact from trade intensity on business cycle synchronisation. Moreover, economic regions with strong financial links are significantly less synchronised and more similar industry structure results in highly correlated business cycle.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Undergraduate learning at programme level: an analysis of students' perspectives</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Turner, Pauline M</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>This research project aimed to understand undergraduate learning at programme level by analysing students’ perspectives. Seventy graduates and undergraduates contributed their perceptions of the learning opportunities they encountered while studying Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Bath, between 1994 and 2005. The methodology employed was qualitative, involving open dialogue (face to face and by email) whereby the students’ concerns dictated the agenda, rather than those of the researcher. Data are presented in narrative form, intended to convey a rounded picture of the richness and variety of students' perceptions of their learning situations, including lectures, practical classes, tutorials, placements, presentations and projects. Preliminary research suggested that learning from professional work placements can be significant, even ‘special’, and placement learning was the initial focus of the project. Research questions crystallised in the following areas: ‘What is the nature of placement learning?’, ‘How does it come about?’ and ‘How does it compare with learning from university-based learning opportunities?’ Preliminary data suggested that undergraduate learning could best be understood through socio-cultural and activity theories of learning (SCAT.Vygotsky, Leontiev and others) but this did not explain the disparity which can occur between intended learning outcomes, envisaged by the University, and the learning which students actually reported. Data from the four year longitudinal study was, therefore, analysed using a framework which was a fusion between SCAT and Theories of Action (comparison between espoused theories and theories in use. Argyris and Schön). The marriage between SCAT and Theories of Action seems to be an informative approach to analysing undergraduate learning in a variety of learning situations, both at university and on placement. In particular, it seems to reveal why students sometimes reported learning little from potential learning opportunities.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>This paper describes personalization metadata standards that can be used to enable individuals to access and use resources based on a user's particular requirements. The paper describes two approaches which are being developed in the library and Web worlds and highlights some of the potential challenges which will need to be addressed in order to maximise interoperability. The paper concludes by arguing the need for greater dialogue across these two communities.</dc:description>

        <dc:creator>Phipps, L</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>The importance of accessibility to digital e-learning resources is widely acknowledged. The World Wide Web Consortium Web Accessibility Initiative has played a leading role in promoting the importance of accessibility and developing guidelines that can help when developing accessible web resources. The accessibility of e-learning resources provides additional challenges. While it is important to consider the technical and resource related aspects of e-learning when designing and developing resources for students with disabilities, there is a need to consider pedagogic and contextual issues as well. A holistic framework is therefore proposed and described, which in addition to accessibility issues takes into account learner needs, learning outcomes, local factors, infrastructure, usability and quality assurance. The practical application and implementation of this framework is discussed and illustrated through the use of examples and case studies.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Since 1999 the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) have provided a solid basis for implementation of accessible Web design. However it is argued that in the context of evaluation and policymaking, inappropriate reference to the WCAG may lead to serious practical difficulties in implementation and monitoring of an effective accessibility policy. There is a pressing need for a framework that guides appropriate application of the WCAG in a holistic way, taking into account the diversity - or homogeneity - of factors such as context of use, audience and audience capability, and access environment. In particular, the current promotion of W3C technologies at the expense of widely used and accessible proprietary technologies may be problematic, as is the apparent reliance of the WCAG on compliant browsing technology. In this paper, a holistic application of the WCAG is proposed by the authors, whereby the context of the Web resource in question and other factors surrounding its use are used to shape an approach to accessible design. Its potential application in a real world environment is discussed.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>The increasing availability of WiFi networks in conference venues is an opportunity to provide additional services for conference delegates and to enhance and enrich the learning experience. This paper reviews experiences of use of networked applications in a conference environment and outlines a number of potentially useful technologies. The paper addresses potential concerns over use of networked technologies including dangers of disruption and distraction, legal and copyright issues as well as the danger of being over-fixated on the technologies themselves, rather than the uses they can provide. The paper concludes by summarising the issues which need to be addressed when considering the provision of networked services in a conference setting.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>The Open Access movement is promoting the advantages in providing more liberal access conditions to research and teaching and learning resources and is developing a legal infrastructure and associated technologies to support this. This paper argues that IT Services can benefit by adopting a similar approach for IT support materials. A case study is provided which describes the rationale for making the resources developed by the JISC-funded QA Focus project available under a Creative Commons licence and the processes needed in order to implement this policy. The paper concludes by describing the potential for widening this approach to generic IT support materials.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>The importance of accessibility to digital e-learning resources is widely acknowledged. The W3C WAI has played a leading role in promoting the importance of accessibility and developing guidelines which can help when developing accessible Web resources. The accessibility of e-learning resources provides additional challenges. In this paper the authors describe a holistic framework for addressing e-learning accessibility which takes into account the usability of e-learning, pedagogic issues and student learning styles in addition to technical and resource issues and provide a case study which illustrates use of this holistic approach to e-learning.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>IT Services - Help Or Hindrance To National IT Development Programmes?</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Kelly, B</dc:creator>

        <dc:description>Factors such as the rapid development of the Web and the onset of the open source software movement have led to renewed IT development activities within higher education. However the deployment of e-learning and related networked applications is often reliant on the support of an institution's IT services department. There is a danger that development work, including development funded by national and international funding programmes, can be hindered by institutional IT services departments. However IT services may feel that developers fail to understand the security, performance and support issues which deployment of applications is likely to entail. This paper provides case studies which illustrate successful efforts at bridging this divide. The paper concludes by arguing for greater common understanding and by describing an emerging framework which can help facilitate the deployment process.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Web site developers should make use of a range of standards and best practices to ensure their Web sites are functional, widely accessible and interoperable. However in practice many Web sites fail to achieve such goals. This short paper describes how a Web site quality assessment method (E-Qual) might be used in conjunction with a lightweight quality assurance framework (QA Focus) to provide a rounded view of Web site quality that takes account of user and supplier perspectives.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>This paper describes a layered approach to selection and use of open standards which is being developed for digital library development work within the UK. This approach reflects the diversity of the technical environment, the service provider's environment, the user requirements and maturity of standards by separating contextual aspects; technical and non-technical policies; the selection of appropriate solutions and the compliance layer. To place the layered approach in a working context, case studies are provided of the types of environments in which the standards framework could be implemented, from an established standards-based service, to a new service in the process of selecting and implementing metadata standards. These examples serve to illustrate the need for such frameworks.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Social Capital in the creation of Human Capital and Economic Growth: A Productive Consumption Approach</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Dinda, Soumyananda</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>Social capital is a broad term containing the social networks and norms that generate shared understandings, trust and reciprocity, which underpin cooperation and collective action for mutual benefits, and creates the base for economic prosperity. This study deals with the formation of social capital through development of human capital that is created from productive consumption. This paper attempts to formalize incorporation of social capital (SK). This paper sets up a one-sector growth model, where the engine of growth is capital accumulation. The production function for final output is of the AK – type, which uses aggregate capital as single input. Aggregate capital is represented by a Cobb-Douglas index comprising three types capital. Human capital accumulation results from productive consumption and an increase in social capital is driven by the existence of human capital. The optimal growth rate of consumption is derived and it is shown that both human capital and social capital accumulation affect the equilibrium growth rate. Finally, paper presents some empirical evidence on social capital and economic growth.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>A theory of electron-hole pair excitation in the adsorption of simple atoms on metal surfaces</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Mizielinski, Matthew</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>Recent experiments have provided direct evidence for the excitation of electronhole pairs during the adsorption of atoms on metal surfaces. The excitation of electron-hole pairs is an inherently non-adiabatic process which is often ignored in standard theoretical treatments of surface phenomena, using tools such as density functional theory (DFT), as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation cannot be used. To obtain a theoretical model for the electronic excitation process it is therefore necessary to go beyond conventional methods. Previous theoretical descriptions have used a nearly-adiabatic approximation to describe electronic excitations. However, these methods have been found to fail in situations where an adsorbing atom undergoes a transition between a spin-polarised and unpolarised state. In this thesis we develop a fully non-adiabatic theory using a simple description of the adsorbate-metal interaction; the time-dependent, mean-field Newns- Anderson model. This model describes a simple electronic system in which a band of metal states interacts with a single atomic orbital, which can undergo a ‘spin-transition’. We derive expressions describing the time-dependent transfer of charge and energy between the adsorbate and surface, as well as the spectrum of electronic excitations generated. Each of these results describe the evolution of the electronic system in terms of a simple set of parameters. These results are demonstrated using a set of example parameter variations to explore the impact of variables such as adsorbate speed and the temperature of the system. A set of parameter variations describing the interaction of hydrogen isotopes with copper and silver surfaces are obtained from DFT calculations. These parameters are used to drive our model through a single approach of the adsorbate to the surface. We find the results of these calculations to be in good agreement with reported experimental results. Our conclusions, and some possible directions for further work, are summarised in the final chapter.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>This research work investigates the information requirements of the engineering designer during the early phases of the design process. In particular, it focuses on the use of standard components, and the information requirements associated with them. The research presents a system for the representation of information, both formal catalogue data, and also what the author has termed "Informal Information". Also presented is a system for the representation of catalogue information that will allow for standard component catalogue interfacing.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Social Incidence of Indirect Taxation in Pakistan (1990 – 2001)</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Refaqat, S</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>This study aims at measuring the social incidence of indirect taxes in Pakistan as a result of the tax reform process specifically carried out in the area of indirect taxes (1990-2001). The intention is to analyze how indirect tax reform reflects the policy objectives particularly in the light of equity and distributional considerations envisaged in the tax reform strategy. Whilst one aim is to reflect on the aggregate indirect tax incidence overtime at the national as well as the urban/rural level, the second objective is to provide a high level of disaggregation of incidence picture in order to explore the sensitivity of tax incidence in terms of key commodities. Additionally, this study attempts to illustrate the sensitivity of estimated tax incidence results to the assumption of zero demand responses and to identify welfare enhancing directions of tax reform for Pakistan at the margin by using the marginal theory of tax reform. The findings of this study seem to indicate that a move from dependence on trade tax revenues to GST/VAT revenues for Pakistan has made the overall indirect tax system a little more progressive. It appears post- reform indirect tax incidence is sensitive to taxation of key commodities including sugar, edible oils and basic fuel/utilities. Incidentally, taxation of these commodities also appears to have strong distributional effects on the poor. Whilst exploring the sensitivity of estimated tax incidence results to the incorporation of behaviour responses, our estimated results do not appear to be very sensitive to this incorporation. Furthermore, directions of welfare enhancing tax reform (at the margin) for Pakistan reveal that a reduction in the price of basic food (including beef, wheat, milk and pulses) should be welfare enhancing; taxation of sugar maybe efficient but not equitable, while only taxation of vegetable ghee simultaneously fits both criterion.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Toric Fano Varieties and Convex Polytopes</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Kasprzyk, A</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>In this thesis we study toric Fano varieties. Toric varieties are a particular class of algebraic variety which can be described in terms of combinatorial data. Toric Fano varieties correspond to certain convex lattice polytopes whose boundary lattice points are dictated by the singularities involved. Terminal toric Fano varieties correspond to convex lattice polytopes which contain only the origin as an internal lattice point, and whose boundary lattice points are precisely the vertices of the polytope. The situation is similar for canonical toric Fano varieties, with the exception that the condition on boundary lattice points is relaxed. We call these polytopes terminal (or canonical) Fano polytopes. The heart of this thesis is the development of an approach to classifying Fano polytopes, and hence the associated varieties. This is achieved by ordering the polytopes with respect to inclusion. There exists a finite collection of polytopes which are minimal with respect to this ordering. It is then possible to “grow” these minimal polytopes in order to obtain a complete classification. Critical to this method is the ability to find the minimal polytopes. Their description is inductive, requiring an understanding of the lower-dimensional minimal polytopes. A generalisation of weighted projective space plays a crucial role – the associated simplices form the building blocks of the minimal polytopes. A significant part of this thesis is dedicated to attempting to understand these building blocks. A classification of all toric Fano threefolds with at worst terminal singularities is given. The three-dimensional minimal canonical polytopes are also found, making a complete classification possible.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Promoting Human Freedoms under Conditions of Inequalities: A Procedural Framework</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Deneulin, S</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>Considering people as agents of their own lives is central in Amartya Sen's freedom-centred approach to development. In that respect, the capability approach grants a fundamental role to the ability to participate in the life of the community, which is referred to as the exercise of political freedom. The paper highlights a major tension between the promotion of human freedoms and the exercise of political freedom, and examines ways in which this tension may be loosened. It suggests that the consequentialist space of well-being evaluation that Sen's capability approach advocates be supplemented by a procedural space. In parallel to Martha Nussbaum's 'thick vague theory of the good', which deals with the indeterminacy of Sen's consequentialist evaluation, the paper proposes a 'thick vague theory of political freedom' that hopes to offer some answers to the problems involved with promoting human freedoms through the exercise of political freedom.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Perfectionism, Liberalism and Paternalism in Sen and Nussbaum's Capability Approach</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Deneulin, S</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>The aim of the paper is to analyse the theoretical foundations of human development policies as found in Sen’s and Nussbaum’s capability approach to development, and to examine to what extent undertaking policies according to the capability approach respects people’s freedom to pursue their own conception of the good. The paper argues that policies undertaken according to the capability approach have to be guided by a perfectionist conception of the good, that is, they cannot avoid promoting one certain conception of the human good. Such a perfectionist conception of the human good, and the policies ensuing from it, have often been qualified as paternalist, depriving the human being of choosing her own conception of the good. The paper examines to what extent those fears of paternalism that seem to underlie policies guided by a perfectionist account of the good are legitimate, and to what extent the capability approach can escape those charges of paternalism and respect each person’s freedom to pursue the human good as she conceives it.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Positron annihilation spectroscopy of voids in silicon</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Potter, Nathan Rees</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>An analysis of nanovoided Silicon is presented. The method of production was high dose implantation of Helium ions followed by annealing. This caused production of two species of defect. The first, large voids several micrometers in diameter, are extensively studied elsewhere in literature. The second, previously unknown defect, are shown to be 30-50 atom defects, some of which are decorated with oxygen. A new analysis technique was developed to characterise these defects. It is shown the previously published measurements of the defects are inaccurate and a superposition of clean and decorated defects. In addition, preliminary work on polarised (magnetised) samples is presented. This utilises the helicity of the polarised positron beam to target spin polarised electrons in iron. It is demonstrated that a clear difference is seen between magnetised and non-magnetised samples even with a weakly polarised beam.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>In DavenportNaylor2003, various observations on the handling of (physical) units in OpenMath were made. In this paper, we update those observations, and make some comments based on a working unit converter that, because of its OpenMath-based design, is modular, extensible and reflective. We also note that some of the issues in an effective converter, such as the rules governing abbreviations, being more linguistic than mathematical, do not lend themselves to easy expression in OpenMath.</dc:description>
